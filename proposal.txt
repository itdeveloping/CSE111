CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    The purpose of this program is to consult information from an MYSQL 
    database in order to calculate the loans that have been made in a 
    company. You must save the information in a CSV file and perform the 
    calculations to determine the number of loans granted per city and 
    the average. There are several types of loans, so an amount must be 
    made for each type of loan. In the end, determine the amount and interest 
    that will be charged by all.

1. What is the title of your program?

    Loan Statistics

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    This program helps to obtain statistics on the number of loans granted 
    by a company.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    With this program, learn to make a connection to an MYSQL database and 
    obtain information from a table that contains the data of the loans.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    Csv, datetime, math, pytest, MYSQL connector

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    Yes, the program is divided into functions to make the code reusable 
    and more readable so that in the future it is easy to update or improve. 
    It will determine what functions are required to achieve the purpose 
    of the program.


6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

   Yeah. I will use the pytest module to test at least two of the functions 
   that will be used in the project.
