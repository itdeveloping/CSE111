Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
I liked the possibility of developing a good function to be reused during the 
program on various occasions or applications. This code can also be reused for 
another program, it is like a formula that is applied to different variants.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Honestly, I struggled with the function test for MySQL, I couldn't manage to use 
the tests for those functions that I have for the database. However, on other 
occasions that I have used the function test, it is very useful and helps me to 
know if the function is well developed.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

The key is to use function testing, however, the way I've been used to working 
is through trial and error. I would like to master that technique of knowing 
how to test any function.
